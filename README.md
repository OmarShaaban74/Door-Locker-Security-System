# Door-Locker-Security-System
## In this project, I implemented a Door Locker Security System designed to unlock a door using a password. The system is based on a layered architecture model with two ATmega32 Microcontrollers running @8MHz.

### ðŸ“š Project Specifications:

#### - Mc1 (HMI_ECU) includes a Human Machine Interface with a 2x16 LCD and a 4x4 keypad. It serves as the user's gateway to the system, allowing them to interact seamlessly and securely. Users can enter and confirm their passwords through the keypad and receive feedback on the 2x16 LCD.
#### - Mc2 (Control_ECU) manages the system with an EEPROM, Buzzer, and Dc-Motor. This control unit is the brain of the operation, responsible for all system processes and decisions. It verifies the entered passwords, controls the motor for door locking and unlocking, and provides security measures for incorrect password attempts.

### ðŸ’¡ System Functionality:

#### 1. **Create a System Password:** Users are prompted to create a 5-digit password through the HMI_ECU. The system ensures password accuracy through a confirmation process. The validated password is stored in the EEPROM for future use.

### 2. **Main Options:** Users can access the main system options through the LCD display on the HMI_ECU.

### 3. **Open Door:** To unlock the door, users enter their password through the keypad, and the HMI_ECU sends this to the Control_ECU via UART. The system verifies the entered password with the one stored in the EEPROM. Upon a match, the door motor rotates for 15 seconds in a clockwise direction (CW) and displays a message indicating that the door is unlocking. The motor is then held for 3 seconds before rotating 15 seconds counterclockwise (A-CW), locking the door.

### 4. **Change Password:** Users can change the system password by entering the current password. The system verifies the entered password with the one stored in the EEPROM. Upon a match, users can proceed to create a new password as in Step 1.

### 5. **Security Measures for Incorrect Password Attempts:** If a user enters an incorrect password during door opening or password change for a total of three consecutive incorrect attempts, the system activates the Alarm System for one minute , and locks the system temporarily.
